ChatGPT said:
If you’ve created an X account and want to follow reliable sources for Australian immigration news — including policy updates, visa announcements and government advice — here are some good accounts & resources you can follow:

✅ Official / Government-linked accounts
Australian Government — @ausgov on X — posts news, policy announcements and government-level updates. 
X (formerly Twitter)

Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) — @dfat on X — though DFAT deals more with foreign affairs and travel/visa-related information. 
DFAT
+1

Department of Home Affairs (Australia) — look for their official social-media channels for visa/immigration & border-control updates (note: their official site is the authoritative place if unsure).

🌐 News portals / immigration-focused blogs
Y-Axis — immigration & visa consultancy that frequently posts updates & blog-posts about Australian immigration policy, visa changes etc. 
RSS Database - FeedSpot

You can also monitor “Australia immigration news” through curated RSS-feed lists / immigration-news blogs aggregated by sites like Feedspot.

📬 Advisory & travel-visa / consular support (if relevant)
If you are applying from India, keep an eye on your nearest Australian High Commission / Consulate social media — e.g. the official account of Australia’s High Commission in India — since they sometimes post visa-servicing updates, alerts or consular guidance.

If you like — I can build for you a list of 8–12 of the best X / Twitter / other social accounts right now that actively post immigration + visa news relevant to Indians moving to Australia.
Do you want me to build that list and share it with you?

If you want analysis, interpretation, applicant-friendly summaries (especially from India) → follow Y-Axis, ThinkVisa, Migration Alliance.

If you want news, policy debates, social context, immigration trends → follow SBS News Australia.

If you like — I can also include 5–10 Telegram / WhatsApp-friendly news-feeds / newsletters (apart from X) that regularly post about Australia immigration (many people prefer these for India → Australia migration).
Do you want me to build that list for you too now?
